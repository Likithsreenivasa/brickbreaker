when any of the side key is being selected game is being started and ball moves towards bricks this movement is given in code.
when ball goes out of bounds in prescribed limits then it raises a message that you haven't reached high score and when click enter it returns to a new game.

when ball breaks all the bricks then game would be over and raises a mesage that "you have reached high score and do you want to restart?" and on clicking enter the game would resume.
